# Where's Waldo?
## An interactive twist to my beloved childhood game

###[See it on Heroku](https://infinite-spire-3805.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies Used

###["What City Is This?"](http://codepen.io/webinnov_france/pen/jEavmZ)
>I came across this code pen with a friend; we immediately forked it and started experimenting with different images and various viewport sizes. We further developed the idea by incorporating images from the book series "Where's Waldo?"

## How It Works
>Move the cursor over the image and find Waldo through the cursor viewport. When you find Waldo, click on him to reveal the entire image!

## Feedback
>I've received various feedback from friends and classmates who have played this game. Many have stated the this 'spotlight' effect on the game makes it much more easier to find Waldo, as it forces the user to focus on a smaller area to find Waldo. On the contrary, I've received comments where users expressed the need to see the entire image during their search for Waldo. Currently, I'm experimenting with various features to incorporate into the game, based on these feedback.

## Coming Soon
### Hint Feature
>The color of the ring will change color, based on how close you are to Waldo. Warmer colors indicate close proximity to Waldo.

### Customize Viewport Sizing
>An experienced user can modify the size of the viewport to make the game easier or more difficult.

### Timed Feature
>A User must find Waldo within the give timeframe.

### Two Player Feature
>Two players will compete to find Waldo using the same image on their individual computer. When a player finds Waldo and clicks on him, the entire image and Waldo's location will be revealed to the other player, with a message delivering the unfortunate news of game over.
